## Trustin's Profile

#### Hey there, thanks for visiting my page. I am currently an exchange student in The Netherlands, reading courses under TU Delft's MSc Computer Science programme. In my home university (National University of Singapore), I am a penultimate Business Analytics major.

#### In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects like [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [monkeytype](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype). I also enjoy building projects around my gaming interests - right now I am building an interactive tool that helps players select optimal moves for winning Pokemon Showdown battles.
