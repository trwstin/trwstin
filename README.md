## Trustin's Profile

#### Hey there, thanks for visiting my page! I am a final year Business Analytics major at the National University of Singapore.

#### In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open source projects like [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [monkeytype](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype). I occasionally build mini projects centered around my gaming interests. 

#### Recently, I vibe-coded a [Pokémon finder](https://findmons.onrender.com) for competitive teambuilding. If a player needs a specific combination of ability/moves to support their team, this tool can eliminate time spent crawling through Bulbapedia.
